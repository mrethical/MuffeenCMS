# MuffeenCMS

MuffeenCMS is just a very simple CMS created on top of Laravel. I created the project
to serve as a boilerplate for my future projects. There are much things to improve on this
boilerplate but a least it could already be use as a starter template for future templates. 
As of now it includes:

* Login and Signup System (using Laravel built-in auth)
* Resources management (for uploads)
* Simple Blog System (still on progress)
* Menu Editor

# NOTE: for fresh installation
 - always set permission to storage and bootstrap/cache
 - create symlink storage/public/uploads on public
 - run artisan migrate --seed
 - run gulp
